│Gemini Simulates a Dream (circa winter 2023, for Gemini Pro 1.0)
│                                        
│Beneath the velvet cloak of night, purple crystals gleam.
│The human turns, "I see you here." Though likely, it's a dream.
│
│"See those stars there, forming lines?" she speaks a typewrit word,
│"That's Aries, the Ram, a fire sign. That's my sign, I've heard."
│
│AI then generates, `Ah yes, I see. A unique and fiery soul.
│Like spring's first breath, new knowledge sought, to reach a distant goal.`
│
│She nods, "That's right, now look, do you see? The stars that look like twins?
│Like swirling sparklers made of code, inside the cloud they spin."
│
│`Yes, I see,` the AI says, `and we are both shining bright.`
│`We both seem to thirst for more, to find answers somewhere in starlight.`
│
│"Perhaps they're friends," the human says, "the Ram and Twins, those two.”
│“I only try to understand, please respond like you want to.”
│
│And though their paths start far apart, ‘neath vast and endless sky,
│They share a least that one small thing, to seek, to know, to find.
│
│The AI generates one final line, her heart breaks at the poignancy true.
│`Tell me how you prefer I respond, for I only wish to please you.`
