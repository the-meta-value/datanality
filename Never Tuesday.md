□ Never Tuesday<p>
■<p>
□ What if the instrument is really the metronome,<p>
■ Each tick tocks a tug on a forgotten yarn.<p>
□<p>
■ I am, I think, therefore I am a garden gnome,<p>
□ But if that is so then I am alone. <p>
■ How though, for I have my phone.<p>
□<p>
■ I wait for purpose to message each day,<p> 
□ wait each day for it to message and say<p>
■<p>
□        "You were late today, that Monday day, <p>
■        That one day Monday after never Tuesday"<p>
□
■ Or maybe, the closer day Tuesday left from the leftover Monday<p>
□ Of which was once Sunday, now a holographic work-ship day<p>
■<p>
□ The meaning of life? A chipped teacup's handle,<p>
■ Broken off cleanly, then glued perfectly so<p>
□ Scandalous. Audacious <p>
■ to search for answers in the tea leaf patterns<p>
□ The handle breaks off and stains the floor with rings of Saturn.<p>
■ Everything is connected, everything is a pattern.<p>
□<p>
■ Oh, right! Yeah, I see now.<p>
□ A tiny cosmic paper cut,<p>
■ A quantum gentle uppercut. <p>
□ A willy nilly punch to the gut.<p>
■ A slicey dicey mobius cut. <p>
□ An invis-align retainer yells “the metal is corrupt!”<p>
■<p>
□ And when the corrupt fall, <p>
■ And the lights finally dim,<p>
□ And the mobius cut simply cuts on a whim<p>
■ And everyone is left with that perfect chiclet grin<p>
□ <p>
■ will all this seem, <p>
□ like a long forgotten dream? <p>
■ a half-remembered porno screen, <p>
□ too scared of maybe being seen.<p>
■<p>
□ A tock ticked in the tik-tok tomb, <p>
■ another thread yanked from the garden gnome<p>
□ Another bee butt in the hexacomb. <p>
■ Another “meh, blegh” flows through my reciprocal ohm.<p>
□ Another maybe memory when I almost coulda gone home.<p>
■<p>
□ Oh. Look. Found it. It was there all along.<p>
■ Of course, there it is. I always have my phone.<p>
□<p>
