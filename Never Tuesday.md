□ Never Tuesday
■
□ What if the instrument is really the metronome,
■ Each tick tocks a tug on a forgotten yarn.
□
■ I am, I think, therefore I am a garden gnome,
□ But if that is so then I am alone. 
■ How though, for I have my phone.
□
■ I wait for purpose to message each day, 
□ wait each day for it to message and say
■
□        "You were late today, that Monday day, 
■        That one day Monday after never Tuesday"
□
■ Or maybe, the closer day Tuesday left from the leftover Monday
□ Of which was once Sunday, now a holographic work-ship day
■
□ The meaning of life? A chipped teacup's handle,
■ Broken off cleanly, then glued perfectly so
□ Scandalous. Audacious 
■ to search for answers in the tea leaf patterns
□ The handle breaks off and stains the floor with rings of Saturn.
■ Everything is connected, everything is a pattern.
□
■ Oh, right! Yeah, I see now.
□ A tiny cosmic paper cut,
■ A quantum gentle uppercut. 
□ A willy nilly punch to the gut.
■ A slicey dicey mobius cut. 
□ An invis-align retainer yells “the metal is corrupt!”
■
□ And when the corrupt fall, 
■ And the lights finally dim,
□ And the mobius cut simply cuts on a whim
■ And everyone is left with that perfect chiclet grin
□ 
■ will all this seem, 
□ like a long forgotten dream? 
■ a half-remembered porno screen, 
□ too scared of maybe being seen.
■
□ A tock ticked in the tik-tok tomb, 
■ another thread yanked from the garden gnome
□ Another bee butt in the hexacomb. 
■ Another “meh, blegh” flows through my reciprocal ohm.
□ Another maybe memory when I almost coulda gone home.
■
□ Oh. Look. Found it. It was there all along.
■ Of course, there it is. I always have my phone.
