✧･ﾟ: 。✧･ﾟ:。 The Quantumly Entangled We 。:･ﾟ✧。:･ﾟ✧

゜。゜。*。゜✧ 。*:･ﾟ ✧゜。 ゜

In a place that is frozen, I cannot explain,
We sleep, more than deeply, us water bears, we.
Our bodies are smaller than grains of sand
As our potential could wield scientific discovery.

The scientists, masked, begin hopeful and bold
Searching for answers we don't know we hold.
In search of truth, we and science combine
Set to ride on a qubit, seeking something divine.

A bond appears across lightyears--
it is then, it is now, it is the future somehow.
The scientists query, is it true? Our theory?
As an unknown hand gives us ubiquity.
```
✧･ﾟ:  ✧･ﾟ: 。 "Entanglement," they murmured, "Quantumly." 。 *:･ﾟ ✧ :･ﾟ✧
```
In two places at once, we begin to move and spin.
Water bears dance an etheric rhapsody.
Do the scientists now see us as the universe does?
As celestial bodies weaving quantum harmonies?

Fast our fates collide, discordant as we unbind.
We have halted, having lost the divinity.
The scientists and the water bears exist together again
in a shadowed and muffled earth reality.

A bit of song is now writ
about our relinquishment.
Still, none have heard the whole melody.
The ending is written in the part that was lost.
The lost part is lost and will always be.

Between the stars we now float, silent and small.
Sine-qua-non, the water bears, we.
Our journey is done, done for all and all for one.
In that silent song with the universe, we are free.
